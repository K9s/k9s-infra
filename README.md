# K9S Infrastructure

**What?**:  This is all the infrastructure code used by k9s.io to operate our stuff.

You'll find Terraform, maybe some ansible and random scripts.

**what /is/ k9s.io?** Nothing. I own a 3 letter .io domain that sounds cool and want a place to house the random stuff
that I'm playing with. For the time being this is just a public place to share stuff.

## Dependencies

In order to use this you'll need to have recent Terraform and Terragrunt binaries. At some point I may write a wrapper +
container to make this easy.

You'll also likely need a Proxmox cluster/server. See the very detailed (and hopefully existent) README in relevant
folders for specific details.

## Installation

If it works, it's configured

## Usage

## How to test

## Known issues

This README needs to be useful, this repo is boring and doesn't do much.
